// In JavaScript, the app.use() method is used to define middleware functions for an express application. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request and response objects, and can perform certain actions before the request is handled by the route handler.

// The difference between app.use(errorHandler()) and app.use(errorHandler) is that in the first example, 
// errorHandler() is a function that is being called, while in the second example, 
// errorHandler is a function or a reference to a function that is being passed to app.use().

// For example:

function errorHandler() {
  // function body
}

app.use(errorHandler()); // This will call the function and pass the return value to app.use()

app.use(errorHandler); // This will pass the function itself to app.use()

// It's important to note that the middleware function must be called with a set of parentheses () in order to execute it. If you pass the function itself without calling it, it will not be executed and will simply be passed as a reference to the app.use() method.
